You are my smart Dev assistant. I want you to help me step by step to fix my TharaGrowth project deployment issues with Firebase Hosting and Firestore. Guide me interactively. 

Current issues:
1. Production shows blank page.
2. Console errors: 
   - Failed to load module script: MIME type "text/html"
   - Firestore Listen 400 Bad Request
   - Google sign-in returns to data collection page
3. Some settings in firebase.json and vite.config.js might be wrong.
4. Need to verify local build and hosting config.

Steps I want you to do with me:

1. Check `vite.config.js` for `build.outDir`. Make sure it points to `dist` (or `dist/public`) so Firebase can serve files correctly.
2. Check `firebase.json`:
   - `hosting.public` should point to the build output (`dist` or `dist/public`)
   - SPA rewrites must redirect all paths to `index.html`.
3. Build project locally:
   - Run `npm run build`
   - Confirm that JS, CSS, and index.html files are present in the build folder
4. Verify environment variables for Firebase in `.env` or GitHub secrets:
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
5. Test the app locally:
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Open browser at http://localhost:5173
   - Check console: no MIME errors, no Firestore 400 errors, Google sign-in works
6. Deploy to Firebase from Replit:
   - Use Firebase CLI: `npx firebase-tools deploy --only hosting`
   - Ensure `FIREBASE_TOKEN` is set in Replit secrets
7. Verify deployed app:
   - Open https://tharagrowth-mvp.web.app in incognito mode
   - Check console for errors
   - Test Google sign-in and Firestore writes

At each step:
- If a problem is found, tell me exactly which file and line to fix, and provide the corrected code.
- Wait for my confirmation before proceeding to the next step.
- Explain why the fix is necessary for the app to load and Firestore to work.
