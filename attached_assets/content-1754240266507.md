Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is exchangerates.host?

Exchangerates.host is a REST API that is a service for current and historical foreign exchange rates and crypto exchange rates.

#### Who runs the API?

Exchangerates.host is a product built and maintained by APILayer, a technology company that provides a variety of reliable and essential APIs for developers. APILayer’s APIs are affordable for both startups and larger companies. APILayer GmbH is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.

#### What is the API’s uptime?

The API's system status is closely monitored around the clock. Every effort is made to ensure the highest possible level of availability and consistency, and we are proud to have an average uptime rate of nearly 100% (99.9%) throughout the last 12 months.

#### Error responses

If your query fails, the API will return false in the success parameter, also HTTP header code 404 Not Found or HTTP 521 Timeout.

#### Which type of historical rates does the API offer?

The API delivers EOD / End of Day historical exchange rates, which become available at 00:05 am GMT for the previous day and are time stamped at one second before midnight.

#### Rate Limits

API requests made by a throttled user or app will fail. All API requests are subject to rate limits. Real time rate limit usage statistics are described in headers that are included with most API responses once enough calls have been made to an endpoint.

#### Response showing old date

API requests are cached by default. You can try to add an additional parameter &v=\_actual\_date\_ in the query, where \_actual\_date\_ enter the day in the format for example Y-m-d (or you can add only hour value).

#### What happens if my allowed volume is exceeded?

Users exceeding their monthly API request limit receive automated email and dashboard notifications at 75%, 90%, and 100%. After reaching 100% of the allowance, overages fees will apply so we make sure you won’t experience any disruptions and your website/application will keep running smoothly. You can learn more about overages billing [here](https://exchangerate.host/documentation#billing-overages).

#### How do I cancel/downgrade?

You can initiate a cancellation or downgrade by selecting a new plan and providing at least one reason for your decision. The customer service team will cancel or downgrade your plan. Downgrades are not effective immediately; your premium subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing period.

#### How do I change between monthly and yearly billing?
